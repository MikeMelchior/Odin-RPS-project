# Odin-RPS-project

In this project I will be creating my first javascript web-page program. I have experience with javascript data structures and algorithms (I have completed the JS data structures and algos course on FreeCodeCamp.org), but I am excited to be able to use some of this knowledge and what I have learned so far on TheOdinProject.com to build a js 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game in a web browser!
